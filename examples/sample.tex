\section{Introduction}

This is a sample LaTeX document for testing CiteAgent.

\section{Background}

Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing by introducing
the self-attention mechanism. This architecture has become the foundation
for many state-of-the-art models in various NLP tasks.

Large language models, while powerful, often suffer from hallucination problems,
generating factually incorrect or inconsistent information. This remains one
of the key challenges in deploying LLMs for real-world applications.

\section{Methods}

Recent work has explored various techniques to mitigate hallucinations,
including retrieval-augmented generation and fact verification systems.
These approaches aim to ground model outputs in verifiable sources.

\section{Conclusion}

The field of natural language processing continues to evolve rapidly, with
new architectures and training methods being developed to address current
limitations.
